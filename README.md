## Introduction

This project's primary goal is to provide an automated system for predicting grocery product sales. The system scrapes, processes, and analyzes historical sales data, then applies machine learning to predict future sales.

## Features

- Automated scraping of sales data from multiple sources.
- Data cleaning and normalization to prepare for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations of sales trends.
- Predictive modeling with neural networks and ensemble methods.
- Model optimization with hyperparameter tuning.
- Docker integration for easy deployment and scaling.

## Requirements

The project requires the following tools and libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn, PMDARIMA, Keras, TensorFlow, Gradio

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Grocery_Sales_Prediction_Project.git
cd Grocery_Sales_Prediction_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
